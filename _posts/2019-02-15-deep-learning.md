Today's content is about the neural network architecture

Initialization is extremely important: determines how statistics of outputs behave; determins how well gradients flow in the beginning of training; limit use of full capacity of the model if done improperly.

deeper networks are more sensitive to initialization. wtih a deeper netowrk, standard deviations of the activation output reduces significantly.
